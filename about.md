Hey, this is Dennis Zhang. I am currently an assistant professor at Washington University in St. Louis.

### More Information

My research interest lies in the intersection of operations management, computer science and economics. I build data-driven models to extract reliable business insights from data (big or small..) and improve existing theoretical models with data.
